## About The Project

Since I started making more and more bots as a joke, I tought I would make an easily clonable template bot. Use it as you will!

## Getting Started

Here are some information you need before running the bot!

### Installation

1. Download it, and extract it to a folder

OR
```sh
git clone https://github.com/berryes/discordjs13-template-bot.git
```

3. Install NPM packages (required)

```sh
npm install
```

4. Enter your API key in  in `config.json`

```JS
    "token": "your-very-long-api-key-here",

```
